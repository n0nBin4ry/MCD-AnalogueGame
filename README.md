# Modular Cat Dungeon
### By: Lisa To, Richard Flores, Sam Behrman, and Shay Golub
A co-operative game where 4 players work together to explore a dungeon and defeat the boss (as cats).

# Da Rules
## Set-up
- All players roll the die. Whoever gets the highest role chooses their class first then takes the corresponding player tile and token;
	the cycle continues in whatever direction the players want (play nice).
- Set the entrance tile (tile with 4 passageways and stairs) in the center of wherever you're playing.
- Shuffle the rest of the tiles and set them face-down in a stack nearby. Do the same with the loot cards.
- Players all place their tokens onto the entrance tile.
- Player turns continue in same order as when choosing classes.
- When loot cards are recieved, players hold them in their hand (or just line them up on the table in front of themselves)
	- Doesn't matter if other players see the cards.
	- No trading or charity.

## Turn Phases
- If you are in combat then reffer to the combat section.
- Any time during your turn, if not in an event or combat, you can manage your inventory which means you can equip/unequip gear.
	- You can only manage your inventory once per turn. (i.e. If you manage gear before moving, you cannot manage gear again after. Even if 
		you were graced with great loot.)
- You may also (if not in combat) chose to wait, retrace, attack, or explore.
	- Wait: Not move from your current tile.
	- Retrace: Move through previously discovered tiles, excluding unset traps and monster occupied rooms.
	- Attack: If there is a monster within range of your move stat, you may launch an offensive on that monster.
	- Explore: Grab a tile from the tile pile and align one of its paths with an open path of your current pile.
		- This can only be done if your current tile is an open path or a tile where an event already passed.
		- If your new tile can only be set up in a way where at least one of it's extra paths lead into another room without connecting
			paths then you must shuffle it back into the pile and draw another tile.
- At the end of your turn, you can choose to discard all potions, scrolls, and unequipped gear then draw the same amount of cards from the loot deck.
	Also known as recycling.
	- The cards redrawn cap at 5 cards. Meaning if a player discards more than 5 cards, they can only draw 5.
	- Discarded cards are shuffled into loot deck after the player draws new cards.
	
## Combat
- If you attack a monster or activate an event that involves a monster you take a card from the monster deck and follow the rules on it.
	- Some events will tell you which monster specifically. Search the deck for it then shuffle the deck afterwards.
	- If the event says a random monster then take the card from the top of the monster deck.
- You can chose to attack or run.
	- If you attack follow the attacking rules on the card.
		- If you slay the monster you draw a card from the loot deck. You can also choose to recycle before ending turn.
		- If you lose the roll, do what the card says. Then your turn ends there and you can try to attack or run on your next turn.
	- If you run follow the run rules on the card.
		- If you escape, you move your token to an adjacent tile who's path connects with your current tile. Your turn ends.
			- If you escape to another tile where there is an unslayed monster then you must immediately commence combat over with new monster.
		- If you lose the roll, do what the card says. Then your turn ends there and you can try to attack or run on your next turn.

## Potions & Scrolls
- Only a Wizard can use scrolls and only a cleric can use potions.
- Either of these two types can be used at any time, even if it's not the player's turn.
- The card can be used on the player themselves or other players on the same tile or adjacent tiles. 

## Dying/Reviving
- Each player has 3 lives. They lost the other 6 preparing for the adventure.
- When a player's HP reaches zero they die and lose a life.
- The player then shuffles all their potions, scrolls, and equipped gear into the loot deck.
- The player comes back the next round with full health at the entrance tile.
	- Players don't come back if they lost all 3 lives.
- The player also has a temporary +1 to their movement stat the next time they choose to retrace.

## Boss Door & the Final Boss
To win the game, the players must defeat the boss:
- To fight the boss you have to find a boss door and a boss key.
- A boss door is a tile, a tile that you eventually fight the monster on.
- A boss key is an item you have to find to open the boss door.
- Once one player decides to open the boss door then all alive players (no matter where they were or what they were doing) are
	teleported to the boss door tile.
- When you fight the boss, grab its card from the monster card pile; folow the rules on that card.
	- On their turn, a player rolls a die and adds that to their attack stat. The monster takes that much damage.
	- At the end of each round, the monster rolls a die and adds that to it's attack stat. Every player in battle takes that much damage.
- If a player dies during the boss fight, they stay dead and their turn is skipped.
	- Lives no longer matter. If a player dies in a boss fight they lose all their remaining lives.

## Losing and Winning
- If you're having fun then everyone wins but if you need a more technical definition then here:
	- Win Conditions: 
		- When the boss is slayed, then every player in the boss battle wins! (even if they died during the boss battle)
			- The player to land the killing blow gets to loot the body for bragging rights, though.
	- Loss Conditions:
		- When a player loses all 3 lives (before the boss battle) they individually lose.
		- If everyone in the boss fight dies, everyone loses.
