# Modular Cat Dungeon (working title)
A co-operative game where 4 players work together to explore a dungeon and defeat the boss (as cats).

# Da Rules
## Set-up
EDITING NOTE: need more cards/tokens for monsters and bosses, etc.
- All players roll the die. Whoever gets the highest role chooses their class first then takes the corresponding player tile and token;
	the cycle continues in whatever direction the players want (play nice).
- Set the entrance tile (tile with 4 passageways and stairs) in the center of wherever you're playing.
- Shuffle the rest of the tiles and set them face-down in a stack nearby. Do the same with the loot cards.
- Finally, players all place their tokens onto the entrance tile.

## Turn Phases
- If you are in combat then reffer to the combat section.
- Any time during your turn, if not in an event or combat, you can manage your inventory which means you can equip/unequip gear and use
	items.
	- You can only manage your inventory once per turn. (i.e. If you manage gear before moving, you cannot manage gear again after. Even if 
		you were graced with great loot.)
- You may also (if not in combat) chose to wait, retrace, attack, or explore.
	- Wait: Not move from your current tile.
	- Retrace: Move through previously discovered tiles, excluding unset traps and monster occupied rooms, for a +1 bonus to move stat.
	- Attack: If there is a monster within range of your move stat, you may launch an offensive on that monster or help out a teamate that
		may also be fighting that monster.
	- Explore: Grab a tile from the tile pile and align one of its paths with an open path of your current pile.
		- This can only be done if your current tile has an open path.
		- If your new tile has can only be set up in a way where at least one of it's extra paths lead into another room without connecting
			paths then you must shuffle it back into the pile and draw another tile.
	
## Combat
- (NOTE: if you guys don't like this we can revert to the basic die roll plus stat.)
- When you are in combat you have 3 choices:
	- Use Item: You can use any item on yourself (or a teamate in same battle) and there will be no attacking from you, meaning you can't flee
		after. There are some items used for attacking, when used it counts as attacking.
	- Attack: You can choose to attack monster.
		- When attacking the monster you compare the power stat with whatever modifiers of you and the monster.
		- Roll the die. Take the difference of the two stats then divide it by whatever you rolled (round down). Inflict that much damage on 
			whoever has the lower stat.
		- If a 3 or 4 is rolled then divide the difference by that (round down) and inflict that damage on the one with the higher stat.
		- You (or a teamate in same tile) can now flee if you'd like.
	- Passing: If more than one player is in combat on the same tile, then player can choose to pass on their turn until its the turn of the last
		person on the tile and do a group attack where everyone who passed add their power stat together.
		- Not everyone has to pass to do a group attack. For example if 4 players are in combat on 1 tile: 1 player can use an item, another can 
			attack by themselves, and the last 2 can do a group attack.
		- You also don't have to wait for the last player explicitly, just the last person to be in the group attack
		- Only one group attack per tile, per round.
		- If the group doing the group attack aquires damage it is divided equally (round up) between the group doing the group attack.

## Mini-Bosses, Boss Door, and Final Boss
Throughout the game you will find mini-bosses. Mini-boses usually come from events where you have a chance for greater rewards. (-EDIT: Not
sure but would be kind of cool). When you have to fight a boss, you draw a tile (EDIT: -Or card?) from the mini-boss pile and fight like any 
other monster. To win the game, the players must defeat the boss:
- To fight the boss you have to find a boss door and a boss key.
- A boss door is a tile, a tile that you eventually fight the monster on.
- A boss key is an item you have to find to open the boss door.
- When you fight the boss, grab a mini-boss from the mini-boss pile and fight it along with the boss multiplier.

## Fleeing
- After a turn of combat (using item or attacking) you can choose to flee from the battle if your speed stat is greater than the monster's;
	move your token to a connected adjacent tile.
- After fleeing, your health and the monster's health return to max (-EDIT: to maybe make healing items only usable in battle for kind of 
	strategic value); you can then fight the monster again the next turn if you want
- If more than 1 players are fighting one monster and one player leaves, the player's health returns to normal the monster's and other players' 
	stay the same. Also that player can't re-enter the tile unless all other player fighting monster flee, die or defeat the monster.
	
## Dying/Reviving
- When a player's HP reaches zero they die.
- A player stays dead until another player kills the monster that killed them.
- For every round a player is dead, they must discard 1 item or piece of gear. If they have no gear or items, they dicard nothing.
- If the monster is slain, the player comes back in the beginning of the next round and places their token on the entrance tile.

## Losing and Winning
- If you're having fun then everyone wins but if you need a more technical definition then here:
	- Win Condition: The final boss is slayed! Players can now enjoy the spoils
	- Loss Condition: Every player is dead.
