# Modular Cat Dungeon (working title)
A co-operative game where 4 players work together to explore a dungeon and defeat the boss (as cats).

# Da Rules
## Set-up
EDITING NOTE: need more cards/tokens for monsters and bosses, etc.
- All players roll the die. Whoever gets the highest role chooses their class first then takes the corresponding player tile and token;
	the cycle continues in whatever direction the players want (play nice).
- Set the entrance tile (tile with 4 passageways and stairs) in the center of wherever you're playing.
- Shuffle the rest of the tiles and set them face-down in a stack nearby. Do the same with the loot cards.
- Finally, players all place their tokens onto the entrance tile.

## Turn Phases
- If you are in combat then reffer to the combat section.
- Any time during your turn, if not in an event or combat, you can manage your inventory which means you can equip/unequip gear and use
	items.
	- You can only manage your inventory once per turn. (i.e. If you manage gear before moving, you cannot manage gear again after. Even if 
		you were graced with great loot.)
- You may also (if not in combat) chose to wait, retrace, attack, or explore.
	- Wait: Not move from your current tile.
	- Retrace: Move through previously discovered tiles, excluding unset traps and monster occupied rooms, for a +1 bonus to move stat.
	- Attack: If there is a monster within range of your move stat, you may launch an offensive on that monster or help out a teamate that
		may also be fighting that monster.
	- Explore: Grab a tile from the tile pile and align one of its paths with an open path of your current pile.
		- This can only be done if your current tile has an open path.
		- If your new tile has can only be set up in a way where at least one of it's extra paths lead into another room without connecting
			paths then you must shuffle it back into the pile and draw another tile.
